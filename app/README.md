# Azure static website demo APP

Front end application created using [NO-FRAMEWORKS-TYPESCRIPT-APP-STARTER](https://github.com/AdamGuar/no-frameworks-typescript-app-starter)

# Tools

## Webpack and webpack plugins
* ts-loader - loader for compiling .ts files and bundling it into bundle.js
* css-loader - loader for compiling styles , MiniCssExtractPlugin - for putting them into separate output css file
* HtmlWebpackPlugin - plugin for fetching index.html entry point from sources and putting it into output folder.

# How to install / run / build

* run `npm install` to fetch dependencies, 
* run `npm start` to start local server, 
* run `npm run build` to build production app - this will result in creating resources in `/dist` folder

Then you only need to update titles, description and apps to start working on your own app.
